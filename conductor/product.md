# Initial Concept
A modern, mobile-first Next.js 16 application for tracking and visualizing household energy consumption (power and gas).

# Product Definition - Energy Consumption Monitor

## Product Vision
The Energy Consumption Monitor aims to empower homeowners and shared-flat residents by providing a seamless, data-driven platform to manage utility usage. By simplifying data entry and providing advanced projections, the application transforms raw meter readings into actionable financial insights.

## Target Audience
- **Individual Homeowners:** Tracking personal utility usage to manage household budgets.
- **Shared Flat Residents:** Looking for fast, transparent calculations to split energy costs fairly.

## Core Goals
- **Cost Management:** Accurately track energy costs and verify provider billing.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Easily compare internal records with official energy provider statements.
- **Financial Projections:** Use historical data to project future costs and consumption trends.
- **Simplified Data Entry:** Minimize the friction of recording meter readings to encourage frequent updates.

## Key Features
- **Streamlined Entry:** Highly optimized mobile-first interface for rapid data logging.
- **Advanced Visualization:** Interactive charts for historical comparisons and trend analysis.
- **Contract Management:** Integration of pricing models (base price, working price) for precise cost calculation.
- **Production-Ready Analytics:** Robust data processing to support real-world budgeting and projections.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Data Privacy & Isolation:** Strict multi-tenant security ensures user data remains completely private.
- **Offline Resilience:** Support for entering readings in environments with intermittent connectivity (e.g., basements).
- **Mobile Performance:** High responsiveness and smooth interactions on a wide range of mobile devices.
