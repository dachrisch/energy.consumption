# Product Guidelines - Energy Consumption Monitor

## Tone and Voice
- **Minimalist and Functional:** The application communicates with direct, no-nonsense language.
- **Efficiency-First:** Messaging is designed to get the user in and out as quickly as possible.
- **Clarity over Fluff:** Avoid marketing jargon; focus on clear labels and immediate feedback.

## Visual Identity
- **Clean Modernism:** A balanced use of white space and rounded components for a contemporary look.
- **Dark Mode First:** The primary interface is optimized for dark environments to reduce eye strain and preserve battery on mobile devices.
- **Material Design:** Leveraging Material Design principles for consistent depth, shadows, and touch interactions.
- **Responsive & Mobile-First:** Every UI element is designed for touch (min 44px target) before scaling for larger screens.

## User Experience (UX) Philosophy
- **Action-Oriented Dashboard:** Front-load projections and critical cost data so users see high-value insights immediately upon login.
- **Input-Focused Design:** The "Add Reading" action is the most prominent and accessible part of the navigation to minimize friction.
- **Comparative Context:** Data is rarely shown in isolation; current consumption is always presented alongside historical trends or contract benchmarks.

## Accessibility and Support
- **Dynamic Font Scaling:** The UI is built using flexible layouts that adapt gracefully to increased system text sizes.
- **High Readability:** Focus on contrast ratios and legible typography for clear data interpretation.
- **Keyboard & Touch Parity:** All features are fully accessible via both precise touch gestures and standard keyboard navigation.
